                <h2> Short Bio </h2>
                <p> I recently graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst  with a bachelor's degree in Women, Gender, 
                    and Sexuality Studies and a Letter of Specialization in Creative Writing. My writing has appeared in the Arts, 
                    News, and Opinion sections of the <a href = "https://dailycollegian.com/"><i>Massachusetts Daily Collegian</i></a>, 
                    as well as literary publications like <a href = "https://websites.umass.edu/jabberwocky/"><i>Jabberwocky</i></a>,
                    <a href = "https://websites.umass.edu/hfaslb/"><i> The Scribe, </i></a> and Volume VII of the UMass Asian American 
                    Student Association magazine. I look forward to an exciting career in journalism and diving into my own creative 
                    entrepeneurial projects. </p>

                <h2> Long Bio </h2>
                <p> I adore all forms of storytelling; from journalism to fiction to poetry and even dance. Throughout my academic 
                    career, I have strived to grow outside of my comfort zone and strengthen my communication skills. That mindset 
                    led to my work being published in the Arts, News, and Opinion sections of the 
                    <a href = "https://dailycollegian.com/"><i>Massachusetts Daily Collegian</i></a>, as well as literary publications. 
                    Three of my <i> Collegian </i> articles were selected to be featured in the paper's print magazine and one was translated 
                    in Spanish. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Last summer, I completed a publishing internship, which gave me a chance to further my editorial skills and think
                    about whether book publishing was right for me. I read fiction submissions each week, provided feedback to writers, and also
                    wrote educational content for the organization's blog using my growing knowledge of SEO best practices. This internship was a 
                    great opportunity, and it taught me that I would rather be a writer than an editor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This year, I look forward to launching an email newsletter, returning to creative writing, and tapping into the worlds of 
                    dance content creation, photography, and wherever my goals take me.
