    <p> With the committments and obligations that come with being a college student, getting into
        meditation might be the last thing on your mind. You might be wondering, 'Why on Earth would 
        I sit down and focus on my breathing when I'm juggling so many things?' But don't underestimate the 
        power of an intentional breath. As simple as meditation seems, it packs a plethora of mental, 
        emotional and physical health benefits that deserve to be prioritized (if you're not convinced, 
        check out <a href = "https://www.prevention.com/health/a22679621/health-benefits-of-meditation/">this article</a> 
        about the benefits of meditation). </p>

    <p> Follow this short guide about how you can get started with meditation as a busy college student. </p> 

    <h2> Getting Started </h2>
    <p> </p>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Start small.</strong> Like with any new habit, starting small is usually the best approach. 
            Whether with a guided meditation or on your own, meditate for small chunks of time, say 5-10 minutes each day, 
            or whatever works for your schedule. I recommend <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB_qUY1dPrs"> this short guided meditation
            </a> for getting started. </li>
        <li> <strong>Decide time of day.</strong> Decide whether you'd prefer meditating in the morning or at night. </li>
        <li> <strong>Be patient with yourself.</strong> It's okay if you skip a day or a week. Be compassionate with yourself. 
            After all, that's what meditation is about.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2> Bonus Tips </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong> Try out different setups before committing to one.</strong> I meditated at different times of the day and listened 
            to different guided meditations before finding that 5-10 minutes before bed works best for me. 
            Experiment to find what works for you.</li>
        <li> <strong> Keep a habit tracker.</strong> I found that tracking how often I meditate motivates me to stay consistent, 
            plus it shows me the progress I've made. Find what motivates you to continue meditating. </li>   
    </ul>
