            <h2>“Amherst is not the middle of nowhere”</h2> 

            <p> I wrote this opinion piece for the University of Massachusetts Amherst student paper, 
                the Massachusetts Daily Collegian. I wrote it at the beginning of the school year, when
                new students would be introduced to the area, aiming to debunk the idea that Amherst and
                the surrounding Connecticut River Valley are 'the middle of nowhere.' This piece was featured
                in the Collegian's general magazine and was translated into Spanish. </p>

            <h2>“Endea Owens and the Cookout perform feel-good jazz in Bowker Auditorium”</h2> 

            <p> I had the opportunity to interview Grammy and Emmy award-winning bassist Endea Owens, who was 
                performing with her band The Cookout at UMass Amherst. The article includes highlights of our 
                conversation and the electric performance that night. It was published with the Arts section 
                of The Collegian. </p>

            <h2>“Old films like 'Casablanca' still have a lot to teach contemporary audiences”</h2>

            <p>This article, written with the Arts section of The Collegian, reflects on the value of old films
                like 'Casablanca'and how they have so much to teach new audiences -- about maintaining hope during 
                turbulent political times, resisting rather than remaining complicit, and making sacrifices. It is 
                a tribute to the power of art in times of uncertainty. </p>
