        <h2> Short Bio </h2>
        <p> Hello, I'm Medha. I am a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst completing my degree in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies
            with a Letter of Specialization in Creative Writing. My work has appeared in the Arts and Opinion sections of the Massachusetts Daily 
            Collegian, as well as literary publications like Jabberwocky and The Scribe. As I get ready for graduation, I look forward to an exciting 
            career in journalism and my own creative entrepeneurial projects. </p>

        <h2> Long Bio </h2>
        <p> I adore all forms of storytelling; from journalism to fiction to poetry and even dance. Throughout my academic career, I've strived to grow 
            outside my comfort zone. That mindset led to my work being published in the Arts and Opinion sections of the Massachusetts Daily Collegian, 
            as well as literary publications like Jabberwocky and The Scribe. Two of my Collegian Articles were featured in the paper's print magazine 
            and one was translated into Spanish. I'm so excited for what opportunities the future holds. 
        </p>
        <p> Last Summer, I completed a publishing internship, which gave me a chance to further my editorial skills and really think about whether publishing
            was right for me. I read fiction submissions each week, and provided constructive critique on a piece's strengths, opportunities for improvement, 
            and suggestions for tightening story. I also wrote educational content for the organization's blog using my knowledge of SEO best practices. 
            This internship was a great opportunity, and it taught me that I would much rather be a writer than an editor. 
         </p> 
         <p> This year, I look forward to launching an email newsletter. But I don't want to stop at writing. I am eager to tap into the world of dance content 
            creation, photography, podcasting, and wherever my goals take me.
